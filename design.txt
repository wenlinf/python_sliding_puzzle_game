The three main boards on the game window are represented by three classes: Puzzleboard, Buttonboard,
and Leaderboard, representing the puzzle game board where the puzzles are displayed, the board where 
the buttons and the player moves are displayed, and the leaderboard where the leaders and the game 
thumbnail are displayed. The Tile class represents the tiles in the puzzles. The game is represented 
by the PuzzleGame class. The puzzle_game.py file serves as a driver file of the game.

For easier management, I created the config.py file to configure all the file paths, turtle
positions and error logging info for the project, so that we do not have to go through the whole project
to change some specific properties. The utils.py contains functions that are used by multiple files.
More common functions can be added here if needed. This way we can avoid repeating the same code
that will be used by multiple files everywhere.
