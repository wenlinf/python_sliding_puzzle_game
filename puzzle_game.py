This program runs a slider puzzle game. Player needs to input
their names and the maximum number of games they want to make
to start the game. While playing the game, players can choose
to reset the game, load a new game, or quit the game. If users
finish the puzzles within the maximum number of moves, they win
the game and their name and score will be written into the
leaderboard file for display. Users can also see how many moves
they have already made on the game window.
